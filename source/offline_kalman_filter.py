    Description:    Kalman filter is used to estimate the ratâ€™s positions
                    when the measurement system fails to track the rat,
                    often in low light situations. The Kalman filter function
                    used is from Pykalman library.

    Takes in as input:
    measurements: nx2 measurements array
    tau: delta t time duration for each frame

    return: kalman estimates of objects' positions and its state covariances

    First, the missing values at the beginning of the measurements array will be dropped.
    Then the measurements will be masked so that the kalman filter will know when there is a missing measurement and
    what to do with them.
    Then the kalman filter will initialize and expectation-maximization function will approximate the error covariances.
    Finally the kalman filter will make estimations of position of the object and return the result:
